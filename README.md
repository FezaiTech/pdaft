# PDAFT


**PDAFT** is a Pushdown Automaton (PDA) simulation example that checks the validity of a given mathematical expression.

This simulation involves:

1. **PDA Class**: Implements the core logic of the PDA, including state transitions and stack operations.
2. **State Transitions**: Defines how the PDA transitions between states based on input characters.
3. **Logging**: Keeps a log of each stage of the PDA processing for debugging and educational purposes.
4. **Flask Web Interface**: Provides a web interface to input mathematical expressions and visualize the PDA processing stages.
5. **Validation**: The PDA can determine if the mathematical expression is valid or invalid based on the final state and stack configuration.
6. **User Interaction**: Users can input mathematical expressions through the web interface, and the results are displayed along with the detailed processing stages.

The PDA simulation supports the following characters:
- Digits (0-9)
- Operators (+, -, *, /)
- Parentheses (())
- Positive Numbers

The primary goal of this simulation is to provide a clear and interactive way to understand how a Pushdown Automaton works, especially in the context of validating mathematical expressions.
